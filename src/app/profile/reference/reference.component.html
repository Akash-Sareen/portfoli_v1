                  Akash and I worked together on a project and I was lucky to have him as a coworker.
                  He is good team player and has excellent knowledge of backend as well as frontend developement. 
                </p>
                <p>Along with that, he is an amazing mentor, with great coordination and time management.
                  Not just with team but also he can manage single handed on given project/assignment with all
                  responsibility.
